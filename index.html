        <p>Starting at an early age, Andrew possessed a strong desire to become a military officer like his father. As a kid, while most of his friends were playing with toys, he found himself instead fascinated by history. Instead of spending his time reading comic books and playing video games, he opted to study <em>tactics</em>, <em>military strategy</em>, <em>world history</em>, and <em>philosophy</em> and found himself in a high school that had a <strong>JROTC</strong><sub><small>1</small></sub> program. Unfortunately, due to underlying health conditions, he was prevented from joining. Andrew did not let this deter him from continuing on in his unending quest to better himself both physically and mentally.</p>

        <p>That desire to succeed manifested in Andrew’s next passion of healthcare, where he went to school for Medical Assisting. He channeled his energy towards both <em>losing 100 pounds</em> and receiving two college degrees. Due to his family situation at the time of graduation, Andrew opted to take a job in a different field to be a provider, showing his malleability and willingness to change. By sheer force of will and the desire to continue in his pursuit of leading a better life, Andrew became one of the first in his family to own his own home. He continued his studies, with a shift towards philosophy and religion and he eventually came to the realization that he needed to do more with his life than simply being a cog in a line.</p>

        <p>One of the pivotal moments of Andrew’s life came about when he befriended a programming genius who later became a professor at an accredited university. This professor reached out to Andrew many times in the past to have him begin a tech career but was unsuccessful until serendipity intervened. Andrew is now on a fast-track to a successful programming career and is looking forward to what his future will hold. </p>
